    <h3> Plagiarism Free Guarantee </h3>
    <p>Plagiarism is one of the things we do not condone in our company. Our disciplined and professional writers always write papers from scratch. To ensure the safety of our clients, we operate multiple professional plagiarism checking systems that will never miss a plagiarized paper. We value our clientsâ€™ time and money, so we aim to provide them with non-plagiarized top-quality papers.</p>

    <p>The cost of checking for plagiarism is already included in the total cost of your order. However, you can request for a plagiarism report for $9.99 to be sent together with your paper. It is a document, which shows the originality of the whole paper and can be useful if you need to show proof to any officials about the originality of your paper.</p>

    <p>The Plagiarism-Free Guarantee has some exceptions. It does not cover orders for proofreading and editing. Our company can only provide clients with plagiarism free papers when our writers write the paper from scratch. When clients give us an already written paper to proofread or edit, we cannot be sure that the provided text was not plagiarized beforehand.</p>

    <p>If a client declares a paper as plagiarized and provides proof from Turnitin.com, he or she can request to have the paper revised free of charge. The paper can be revised by the same writer if he/she is a preferred writer or it can be assigned to another writer.</p>

    <p>In any case, we rarely have issues with plagiarism, but when we do, it is easily resolved. Our aim is to keep you happy and satisfied with our services for as long as you are with us.</p>
